        <img src="images/Sweller's.jpeg" alt="Sweller's Theory Illustration" />

    <p>In teaching and learning, teachers need to help students understand lessons without feeling confused or stressed. One theory that explains this is <strong>Cognitive Load Theory</strong> by <strong>John Sweller</strong>. This theory talks about how students use their brain to learn new things and how teachers can help them manage information in their mind.</p>
    <p>In this writing, I will explain how my teaching method, called <strong>Picture Description</strong>, follows the ideas in Cognitive Load Theory. I will also explain about <strong>Intrinsic Load</strong> and <strong>Extraneous Load</strong>, and how I control both of them in my teaching.</p>

    <h2>Cognitive Load Theory</h2>
    <p><strong>Cognitive Load Theory (CLT)</strong> is a theory from <strong>John Sweller</strong>. He said that the human brain has a limited space to remember new information. If there is too much information at one time, students can get confused and cannot learn well. So, teachers must give information in a good way and control the amount of information in students’ minds.</p>

    <h3>Intrinsic Load</h3>
    <p>Intrinsic Load is the difficulty level of the material itself. Some lessons are easy, but some are hard. For example, learning about simple vocabulary is easier than making a long sentence in English. The more difficult the lesson, the higher the intrinsic load. As a teacher, I cannot change the difficulty of the material, but I can divide it into small parts or give clear examples to make it easier for students to understand.</p>

    <h3>Extraneous Load</h3>
    <p>Extraneous Load is the extra burden in students’ minds caused by the way the teacher explains or gives activities. If the explanation is too long, too fast, or unclear, students will get confused. Also, if the learning activity is too complicated, students will not focus on the material, but on trying to understand the activity. As a teacher, I need to reduce this extraneous load so students can focus on the important things.</p>

    <h2>How Picture Description Matches Cognitive Load Theory</h2>
    <p>I use <strong>Picture Description</strong> in my teaching. In this activity, students look at a picture and describe what they see. This method is simple and interesting, and it also matches the principles of Cognitive Load Theory.</p>

    <h3>1. Controlling Intrinsic Load</h3>
    <p>Learning speaking or writing in English can be difficult for students, especially if they have to make long and correct sentences. This means the intrinsic load is high.</p>
    <p>To control this, I:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose simple and clear pictures for beginners.</li>
        <li>Start with easy instructions, like “What can you see in the picture?”</li>
        <li>Use pictures related to their daily life (family, school, animals) so they already know the vocabulary.</li>
        <li>Slowly move to more difficult pictures when students are ready.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This makes the lesson easier to follow and reduces stress from difficult material.</p>

    <h3>2. Reducing Extraneous Load</h3>
    <p>Sometimes, the problem in class is not the material but the way the teacher explains it. If instructions are confusing or too many at once, students will feel heavy in their minds. This is called extraneous load.</p>
    <p>To reduce this, I:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Give clear and short instructions.</li>
        <li>Show examples before students do the activity.</li>
        <li>Use simple language when giving directions.</li>
        <li>Avoid unnecessary decorations or complicated pictures.</li>
        <li>Focus on one skill at a time, like only speaking or only writing, not both together.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By doing this, students can focus on describing the picture, not on understanding difficult instructions or confusing tasks.</p>

    <h3>Example of the Activity</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Show a picture of a park.</li>
        <li>Ask students: “What can you see in the picture?”</li>
        <li>Give an example: “I can see a tree.”</li>
        <li>Let students describe other things.</li>
        <li>Give feedback and correct mistakes.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This simple step-by-step activity helps control intrinsic load because the topic is easy. It also reduces extraneous load because instructions are clear and short.</p>

    <h2 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, my teaching method, <strong>Picture Description</strong>, follows the principles of <strong>Cognitive Load Theory</strong> by <strong>John Sweller</strong>. This method helps control Intrinsic Load by choosing easy materials and dividing lessons into small parts. It also reduces Extraneous Load by giving clear instructions, using simple pictures, and avoiding confusing explanations.</p>
    <p>By managing these two types of cognitive load, students can learn better, focus more, and enjoy the learning process. I believe this method is very useful, especially for teaching English speaking and writing skills to beginner students.</p>
